\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
\textbf{Students\&Companies} (S\&C) is an internship university platform that allows matching between students seeking internships and companies offering them. The platform's goal is to facilitate the process of matching students with companies based on student skills, experiences, and interests with the needs and opportunities provided by companies.\\
There are mainly two ways to establish a connection between the two parties: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Recommendation system}: Whenever a new internship becomes available, students compatible with the requirements specified by the company get notified and can decide to apply.
	\item \textbf{Proactive searching}: Students can go through the available internships and apply for the ones they are interested in.
\end{itemize}
When an internship starts through the recommendation system, S\&C collects various kinds of information regarding the quality of the recommendation, for example by asking students and companies to provide feedback and suggestions. \\
The platform helps with the selection process by managing interviews and finalizing choices. It also offers spaces where users can report issues, share concerns, and give updates on the status of an ongoing internship.

\subsubsection{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{[G1] - Student can create an account} \\
Students need to select from a list containing all affiliated universities and then they can create their account using their institutional credentials to verify their status as a student. \\
In addition they have to add their CV, a list of their interests and optionally a list of companies that might interest them.
\item \textbf{[G2] - Company can create an account} \\
Companies need to create their account using a certified email to verify the legitimacy of the company. \\
In addition they can add a detailed description and a list of previous projects that might help them stand out more.
\item \textbf{[G3] - Users can update their accounts} \\
Through a dedicated sections users can update the information stored in their account.
\item \textbf{[G4] - Companies can create internships} \\
A company that has an account on the platform, after logging in using the credentials chosen during the sign up process, can create an internship specifying the skills, experiences and interests required.
\item \textbf{[G5] - Students can view all available internships} \\
A student that has an account on the platform, after logging in using the credentials chosen during the sign up process, can navigate through the available internships created by different companies via a specific search system.
\item \textbf{[G6] - Companies can create forms for students to fill} \\
The application has a dedicated section that allows companies to create forms for the internship they are posting.
\item \textbf{[G7] - Recommendation system} \\
Whenever a company creates an internship, all the students that satisfy the requirements specified in the offer are notified. All the students interested in the internship have limited time to apply. At the end of this period, the applications are closed and the list of interested students are sent to the company, that could decide to select a smaller group of students for the selection process.
\item \textbf{[G8] - Students can apply for the internships} \\
When proactively searching for internships, students can choose the ones that interest them the most and apply for them.
\item \textbf{[G9] - Form evaluation} \\
The company evaluates all the submitted forms for an internship by giving a score to each one.
\item \textbf{[G10] - Ranking candidates} \\
A ranking of the candidates will be created at the end of the form evaluation stage based on the scores achieved in the questionnaires and updated at the end of the interviewing stage.
\item \textbf{[G11] - Users can provide feedbacks} \\
When an internship starts through the recommendation system, both students and companies can provide feedback regarding the quality of the recommendations offered by the system.
\item \textbf{[G12] - Complaints management} \\
During an internship both parties, companies and students, can use an ad hoc function to write complaints regarding the other party.
\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Scope}
	The platform facilitates interaction between three distinct user categories:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Companies (internship providers)
	\item Students (possible candidates)
	\item Universities (complaint managers)
\end{itemize}
Companies maintain primary responsibility for internship creation and management. Each internship posting must provide this information:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Required skills
	\item Relevant past experiences
	\item Candidate interests
\end{itemize}
During the internship posting, the company can create forms to be filled by the students. In the course of the selection process, performance metrics are collected through the submitted application's form and a final ranking of the candidates is generated. Internship positions will be allocated according to the candidate's rank and the number of available slots. \\
Students can apply for the internship that interest them and if the company accepts they will move to the selection process. \\
Universities can monitor the status of ongoing internships that involve their students and in extreme cases they might interrupt them.

	\subsection{Product perspective}
		\subsubsection{Scenarios}
\textbf{\large{Scenario 1}} - ToSoftware wants to advertise its internships \\
ToSoftware is a big company looking for young talents that could be interested in working full time for them in the future. An HR employee is tasked to design internships and would like to advertise its offers to students. For this purpose he creates an S\&C account using his work email, he also need to provide his personal information and some details about the company. After the creation has been completed he starts creating the post for an internship including details such as the project domain, tasks, required skills/experiences, the applications deadline and any other relevant information.
\vspace{1\baselineskip} \\
\textbf{\large{Scenario 2}} - Bob wants to do an internship \\
Bob is a third year student at the Genius University and thinks about gaining some work experience, but he does not know from where to start from. His friend Sam tells him about S\&C, so he creates an account by choosing Genius University from the available list, enters his institutional email and also adds his interests and CV. At this point he starts looking for an internship, using the search-bar he inserts some keywords to ensure he finds something he is interested in. After confirming the filters, Bob is presented with a list of internships that satisfy the inserted keywords, he selects the one he finds more suitable for himself and applies for it.
\vspace{1\baselineskip} \\
\textbf{\large{Scenario 3}} - Sekiro receives a notification through the recommendation system \\
ToSoftware's S\&C's account manager designs an internship that involves helping in the development of its new game "Light Souls" and posts it on the platform. Sekiro is a student of the Genius University, studying computer science. Some time ago he created an S\&C account and specified his interest in game development, so as soon as ToSoftware posts the internship, Sekiro receives a notification that informs him about the offer. The notification reports all the important information about the internship:
\begin{itemize}
\item[] \textbf{Title} : Student experience as game developer
\item[] \textbf{Description} : We are looking for students willing to have a taste of the working environment at our company while assisting with the development of our new game "Light Souls".
\item[] \textbf{Application deadline} : 22\textsuperscript{nd} December, 2024
\item[] \textbf{Location} : Japan
\end{itemize}
\vspace{1\baselineskip}
\textbf{\large{Scenario 4}} - Sekiro applies for ToSoftware's internship \\
Sekiro decides that the internship proposed by ToSoftware is perfect for him so he decides to apply for it. The 22\textsuperscript{nd} of December (applications' deadline) ToSoftware receives a list of all the students that applied for their internship. Since there are too many candidates they decide to pick a limited number of them. After some time, Sekiro receives a notification saying that his application for the internship was accepted and he has to fill in a form before the 22\textsuperscript{nd} of January 2025. As soon as Sekiro submits the form with all the questions answered, ToSoftware's account receives a notification containing the filled form, so an employee gives a score to each answer and saves it. The 22\textsuperscript{nd} of January the employee checks the ranking generated by the application and picks the top 10 candidates. Since Sekiro ended up in second place he receives a notification containing the date (22\textsuperscript{nd} of February) for an interview and a link to a broom meeting. A week after the interview, Sekiro receives a notification informing him that he passed the final screening and containing all the necessary info regarding the upcoming internship.  
\vspace{1\baselineskip} \\
\textbf{\large{Scenario 5}} - ToSoftware shares his opinion regarding the recommendation system \\
ToSoftware's S\&C's account manager, notices that all the students participating in the internship are really talented and hard working so he decides to write a feedback to let S\&C developer know. As soon as he is done writing it, he sends it and the message is stored in S\&C database as a positive feedback.
\vspace{1\baselineskip} \\
\textbf{\large{Scenario 6}} - Sekiro is exploited by the company \\
Since Sekiro is performing incredibly good, ToSoftware's internship manager decides to give him more work to do, even though he knows Sekiro was barely managing the few task he was given before. Noticing the increasing amount of work, Sekiro decides to write a complaint about the company on the platform. The complaint is then saved and can be seen by Sekiro's university (Genius University) using the platform whenever they decide to check how his internship is going.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Images/Class_Diagram}
\end{figure}
\newpage
		\subsubsection{State Chart}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.185]{Images/Internship_state_diagram} \\
Right after an internship is created its state is the \textit{Open for applications} state, where students can apply for it. Subsequently to the application deadline, the company will have to select the candidates that suit them the most from those who applied, this is during the \textit{First screening} state. Each selected candidate will receive a notification regarding the result of his application which also includes a form to be filled by a specific date (if they were accepted). Following that date, we arrive at the \textit{Second screening} state where the company has to evaluate the forms filled by each accepted candidate leading to a total score, which S\&C will use to rank all of the candidates. S\&C will then choose (possibly among the best scoring) a subset of those students, all candidates will receive a notification with the result and for those that have been chosen it will also contain a link to a third-party online meeting platform and the date of the interview. After the aforementioned date, we reach the \textit{Ranking} state where the remaining candidates will be further evaluated according to their performance during the interview. This will result in a conclusive ranking which will be used to decide the students that will be accepeted for the internship. Finally, we have the \textit{Ongoing} and \textit{Finished} states that are indicating when the internship is effectively in progress (here both parties can submit complaints) and when it is complete; after which feedback will be asked from students in case they received the offer through the recommendation system. At this point, the internship will be archived as a past project of the company.

	\subsection{Product functions}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Sign-up and login} \\
Both of these functionalities are going to be available to all user categories. \\
The sign-up functionality allows users to create a verified account to use on the platform. Each user will be asked to provide personal data such as name, surname, email, username and password. The user category will be recognized based on the domain of the email used for the sin-up. \\
The login functionality allows user to gain access to an already existing account using the credentials used during sign-up.
\item \textbf{Update account information} \\
This functionality is only available for all user categories. \\
A student can only update a new CV and change its interests, since all the personal information are extracted from the institutional email. \\
A company can only update the description and add old projects.
\item \textbf{Post internship} \\
This functionality is available only for companies. It allows them to create a new post based on an internship they designed. The post must contain a title, a description describing the various activities, the skills required from the candidates to have a chance in being chosen. It also needs all the deadlines like the applications deadline, after which students are not allow to apply for the internship, and the form compilation deadline, that can be added after the applications deadline. And lastly it needs to specify the location an the period of the internship.
\item \textbf{Create a custom form} \\
This functionality is available only for companies. At some point companies need to create a form that allows the to select faster the candidates for the internship. The form is created by adding a list of questions and for each question it needs to be specified a maximum score that will be used to generate the ranking during the selection process. The form can be created at any time, during the posting process or even before the screening.
\item \textbf{Search for specific internships} \\
This functionality is available for all user categories, but is designed to be used mostly by students. Through a search bar users can look for specific internships or use keywords to filter through the one they are seeking.
\item \textbf{Apply for internship} \\
This functionality is only available for students. This action is going to save the student as a candidate for the internship. At the end of the applications deadline, his CV will be sent to the company with to ones of all the other students that applied for the same internship.
\item \textbf{Screen candidates} \\
This functionality is only available for companies. When the applications period ends and the company is sent the list of candidates, the company's employee will be able to select the candidates that he considers suitable for the internship and discard the one that are not.
\item \textbf{Evaluate form} \\
This functionality is only available for companies. When the company receives a submitted form, this functionality allows them to check the answers given by the candidate and grade them. Once all the answers has been graded and the company's employee closes the form, the system evaluates the total score and adds it to the ranking.
\item \textbf{Send feedback} \\
This functionality is only available for all user categories. Using this feature user can share their opinion with S\&C developers regarding the functionalites implemented in the software.
\end{itemize}

	\subsection{User characteristics}
In this section it is provided a more distinct characterization of the two user categories of the platform.
		\subsubsection{Company}
A company is a representative of a company that wants to advertise its internships. After creating an account as a company, the user gains access to all the company reserved functionality such as internship posting, custom form creation, candidates screening and form evaluation.
		\subsubsection{Student}
A student is an individual whose aim is to either improve his skills or make experience in a professional context. To be able to create an account he must be affiliated with a university and own an institutional email.
		\subsubsection{University}
A university is an institution whose aim, in the context of S\&C application, is to monitor the current status of an internship that involves its students and they are responsible for handling complaints, especially the ones that might require the interruption of the internship.

	\subsection{Assumptions, dependencies and constraints}
\begin{spacing}{1.5}
\textbf{\textit{A1}} - All users have a valid active email. \\
\textbf{\textit{A2}} - Students upload the correct file in the CV section of their account. \\
\textbf{\textit{A3}} - Companies post correct information about existing internships. \\
\textbf{\textit{A4}} - Companies create reasonable forms before the applications deadline. \\
\textbf{\textit{A5}} - The recommendation system is reliable enough. \\
\textbf{\textit{A6}} - Companies check all submitted forms and for each of them grade all questions. \\
\textbf{\textit{A7}} - Feedback and complaints provided by users are truthful and accurate. \\
\textbf{\textit{A8}} - The platform has a list of all the affiliated universities.
\end{spacing}
\newpage
\section{Specific requirements}
	\subsection{External interface requirements}
		\subsubsection{User interfaces}
The platform is presented as a series of different pages, each specialized for one or more features with the same scope. The following ones are considered the most important:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Login / Sign up page} \\
This page allows the user to choose between one of the two functionalities and insert personal data in different ways based on the option chosen.
\item \textbf{Home Page} \\
In this page users can visualize all the internships that have per posted. In addition there is a search bar that, by entering keywords, allows user to look for specific types of internships.
\item \textbf{Internship creation page} \\
This page is available only for companies, and allow them to fill in all the details required to post about an internship.
\item \textbf{Form design page} \\
This page is available only for companies and it allows them to create custom forms needed to select the candidates that apply for their internship. To create forms, companies write a list of questions and mark them with a maximum score achievable by each one of them. At the end of this process the form can be saved for later use.
\item \textbf{Profile page} \\
This page displays all personal information regarding the user logged in the application. It also allows the user to update different information based on the fact that they are students or companies.
\end{itemize}
		\subsubsection{Hardware interfaces}
The application does not need to provide any kind of hardware interface since it's main purpose is advertising internships and establish a connection between students and companies.
		\subsubsection{Software interfaces}
The software will need to use some external interface to guarantee its correct behavior. For example, to guaranteed the validity of an institutional email, it needs the university to confirm the address, and the same goes for the company.
		\subsubsection{Communication interfaces}
The platform exploits the internet connection to communicate with the main server in order to store and retrieve all the necessary information and also to perform automatic actions such as sending notification, identifying compatible students for the recommendation system and closing an internship's application's process according to the specified deadline.

	\subsection{Performance requirements}

Most of the times the application acts as a database for companies' internships, when students are navigating through the available offers or proactively searching for them. \\
The rest of the time the application acts as a simple notification system that allows students to be alerted when an interesting offer is posted, or to be notified of the result of the various screenings when applied for an internship. \\
For this reason the system's performance limits must be calculated by considering this two conditions: 
\begin{itemize}
\item The minimization of the time needed for querying the database.
\item The minimization of the time needed to send notifications.
\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Design constraints}	
		\subsubsection{Standards compliance}

\textbf{Disclosures and privacy policies} \\
The application fully comply with data protection regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for European users and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) for American users. The system only collects data necessary for its operation, and users have the right to access, modify, or delete their data as per GDPR requirements.\\
\\
\textbf{Encryption and anonymizing} \\
Since the application highly depends on internet connectivity for syncing data, user authentication, and notifications, security is a top priority. The software uses TLS 1.2/1.3 encryption to ensures that all data exchanged between users’ devices and the servers is encrypted and protected from interception or unauthorized access.\\
\\
\textbf{Data storage} \\
For data storage, the software complies with ISO/IEC 27001 standards, ensuring high levels of security, and data protection. This includes regular data backups, disaster recovery protocols, and server redundancy to prevent data loss and maintain consistent up time.
		
		\subsubsection{Hardware limitations}

The software shall be designed to run efficiently on minimal hardware, making it accessible across a wide range of devices, including older computers and lower-end mobile devices.
		
		\subsubsection{Any other constraints}
		
The platform is intended to connect student and companies from all over the world. For this reason, it should be designed completely in English, allowing all user to understand all the features.
		
	\subsection{Software system attributes}
		\subsubsection{Reliability}

The application shall be designed to operate reliably under a range of conditions, and the notification system must be robust enough to ensure that users can consistently complete their tasks without any problems, like applying for internships, filling forms and so on.
		
		\subsubsection{Availability}
		
To maximize availability, the application shall operate a distributed cloud infrastructure with redundant servers, to ensure consistent up time. The application achieves a targeted up time of 99.9\%, minimizing disruptions and providing users with dependable access whenever needed.
		
		\subsubsection{Security}
		
As mentioned in section 3.4.1, to match the GDPR compliance, user authentication shall be handled via secure protocols, such as OAuth 2.0, allowing users to log in through trusted providers while protecting their credentials. \\
In addition the system use TLS 1.2/1.3 encryption for data transmission, to protect it from external parties.
		
		\subsubsection{Maintainability}
		
The application is developed using modular code architecture that makes updates and bug fixes as efficient and straightforward as possible. The software code base is well-documented and follows standard coding practices and patterns, making it easy for developers to understand and work with. Additionally, a version control system, such as Git, is in place to manage updates, ensuring that updates do not disrupt user experience.
		
		\subsubsection{Portability}
		
The software shall be designed to be portable across multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android, allowing users to have access to their account from any device. The software shall be developed with cross-platform compatibility in mind, using frameworks and libraries that support different operating systems.
