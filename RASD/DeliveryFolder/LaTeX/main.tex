\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
\textbf{Students\&Companies} (S\&C) is an internship university platform that allows matching between students seeking internships and companies offering them. The platform's goal is to facilitate the process of matching students with companies based on student skills, experiences, and interests with the needs and opportunities provided by companies.\\
There are mainly two ways to establish a connection between the two parties: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Recommendation system}: Whenever a new internship becomes available, students compatible with the requirements specified by the company get notified and can decide to apply.
	\item \textbf{Proactive searching}: Students can go through the available internships and apply for the ones they are interested in.
\end{itemize}
When an internship starts through the recommendation system, S\&C collects various kinds of information regarding the quality of the recommendation, for example by asking students and companies to provide feedback and suggestions. \\
The platform helps with the selection process by managing interviews and finalizing choices. It also offers spaces where users can report issues, share concerns, and give updates on the status of an ongoing internship.

\subsubsection{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{[G1] - Student can create an account} \\
Students need to create their account using the university credentials to verify the status as a student. \\
In addition they have to add their CV, a list of their interests and optionally a list of companies that might interest them.
\item \textbf{[G2] - Company can create an account} \\
Companies need to create their account using a certified email (PEC) to verify the legitimacy of the company. \\
In addition they can add a detailed description and a list of previous projects that might help them stand out more.
\item \textbf{[G3] - Users can update their accounts} \\
Through a dedicated sections users can update the information stored in their account.
\item \textbf{[G4] - Companies can create internships} \\
A company that has an account on the platform, after logging in using the credentials chosen during the sign up process, can create an internship specifying the skills, experiences and interests required.
\item \textbf{[G5] - Students can view all available internships} \\
A student that has an account on the platform, after logging in using the credentials chosen during the sign up process, can navigate through the available internships created by different companies via a specific search system.
\item \textbf{[G6] - Companies can create forms for students to fill} \\
The application has a dedicated section that allows companies to create forms for the internship they are posting.
\item \textbf{[G7] - Recommendation system} \\
Whenever a company creates an internship, all the students that satisfy the requirements specified in the offer are notified. All the students interested in the internship have limited time to apply. At the end of this period, the applications are closed and the list of interested students are sent to the company, that could decide to select a smaller group of students for the selection process.
\item \textbf{[G8] - Students can apply for the internships} \\
When proactively searching for internships, students can choose the ones that interest them the most and apply for them.
\item \textbf{[G9] - Form evaluation} \\
The company evaluates all the submitted forms for an internship by giving a score to each one.
\item \textbf{[G10] - Ranking candidates} \\
A ranking of the candidates will be created at the end of the interviewing stage based on the scores achieved in the questionnaires.
\item \textbf{[G11] - Feedback} \\
When an internship starts through the recommendation system, both students and companies can provide feedback regarding the quality of the recommendations offered by the system.
\item \textbf{[G12] - Complaints management} \\
During an internship both parties, companies and students, can use an ad hoc function to write complaints regarding the other party.
\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Scope}
	The platform facilitates interaction between two distinct user categories:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Companies (internship providers)
	\item Students (possible candidates)
\end{itemize}
Companies maintain primary responsibility for internship creation and management. Each internship posting must provide this information:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Required skills
	\item Relevant past experiences
	\item Candidate interests
\end{itemize}
During the internship posting, the company can create forms to be filled by the students. In the course of the selection process, performance metrics are collected through the submitted application's form and a final ranking of the candidates is generated. Internship positions will be allocated according to the candidate's rank and the number of available slots. \\
Students can apply for the internship that interest them and if the company accepts they will move to the selection process.

	\subsection{Definitions, acronyms and abbreviations}
		\subsubsection{Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Users} $\rightarrow$ The users of the applications are both students and a representatives of their company.
\item \textbf{Internship} $\rightarrow$ It refers to projects created by companies to allow students to gain experience in a professional context.
\item \textbf{Posting} $\rightarrow$ It is the act of creating an internship and rendering it public for the students to view.
\item \textbf{Proactive searching} $\rightarrow$ Indicates the action performed by a student to take the initiative and look for the internship that interests them the most.
\item \textbf{Apply for internship} $\rightarrow$ Indicates the action performed by a student to inform the company responsible for that internship of their interest in participating.
\item \textbf{Questionnaires/Forms} $\rightarrow$ They are both used to represent the same concept of a list of questions created by the company to evaluate the candidates.
\item \textbf{Score} $\rightarrow$ The score of a form is the sum of the points achieved in each question. Since each question has a maximum limit of points, then the whole form will have such a limit.
\item \textbf{Feedback} $\rightarrow$ It represent the opinion of the user regarding a specific feature that they tried out.
\item \textbf{Resume} $\rightarrow$ It is the same as referring to a CV.
\end{itemize}
		\subsubsection{Acronyms}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{S\&C} $\rightarrow$ Students\&Companies, the name of the application.
\item \textbf{CV} $\rightarrow$ Curriculum Vitae, is a short written summary of a person's career, qualifications, and education.
\item \textbf{PEC} $\rightarrow$ "Posta elettronica certificata", is an email meant to provide a legal equivalent of the traditional registered mail, where users are able to legally prove that a given email address is certified.
\item \textbf{API} $\rightarrow$ Application Programming Interface, a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.
