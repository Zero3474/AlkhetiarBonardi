\section{Introduction}
	\subsection{Purpose}
This design document outlines the architectural framework, user interface design, and other system components necessary to meet the functional and non-functional requirements described in the Requirement Analysis and Specification Document. \\
It also serves as a foundation for developers, testers, and stakeholders to understand the system's structure and ensures that the final implementation adheres to the defined goals. \\
The main purpose of the S\&C platform is to grant efficient and effective matchmaking between university students seeking experience through internships and companies offering them. The design aims to ensure:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Precision in matching}: The system adopts a sophisticated recommendation system to notify students about suitable internships, based on criteria such as skills and experiences.
\item \textbf{Smooth user experience}: The system shall grant its users the best experience by smoothly managing all internship-related workflows, including searching, application, selection, feedback collection, and monitoring of ongoing internships.
\item \textbf{Scalability}: The system's design shall accommodate future adjustments, such as advanced data analytics, integration with external tools, or even an expanded scope.
\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Scope}
\textbf{Students\&Companies} (S\&C) is an internship platform designed to connect students with companies based on skills, experiences, and interests. \\
The platform offers two main ways to establish connections:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Recommendation system}
\item \textbf{Proactive searching}
\end{itemize}
S\&C also supports the selection process  and gathers feedback on recommendations and provides spaces for users to address issues, share updates, and track internship progress.
More details can be found in the RASD document.

\section{Architectural design}
	\subsection{Overview}
The S\&C design is based on two architectural choices:
\begin{itemize}
\item Microservices architecture
\item Thin-client model
\end{itemize}
This choices were made to ensure scalability and modularity, making it easier to modify the system in the future or simply for maintenance.\\
Thanks to the microservices approach, the system shall be divided into separate and independent modules, each of which is responsible of a single feature, like user management, recommendation system, internship management and report collection.\\
The thin-client approach instead, ensures the smoothest experience for the users, by keeping the client-side of the application as lightweight as possible. With this approach the client shall focus solely on the rendering of the user interface and the management of basic interactions, the rest of the computation happens on the server-side.\\
To facilitate the communication between client and the backend, the system shall implement well-defined RESTful APIs.

	\subsection{Component view}
\subsection{Component View}

The \textbf{Students\&Companies (S\&C)} platform is built around modular and decoupled components following a microservices architecture. Each component is responsible for specific functionalities, ensuring a clean separation of concerns, scalability, and ease of maintenance.

\subsubsection{Key Components}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User Management Service} \\
    Responsible for managing all user-related operations, including:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Registration and login processes for students, companies, and universities.
        \item Authentication and authorization using secure protocols like OAuth 2.0.
        \item Profile management, enabling users to update personal information, resumes, and company details.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Internship Management Service} \\
    This service handles all functionalities related to internships:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Creation, modification, and deletion of internship postings by companies.
        \item Managing application workflows, including CV submissions and application tracking.
        \item Integration with the recommendation system to notify eligible students.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Recommendation Service} \\
    A core component of the platform, responsible for matching students to internships based on:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Skills and interests specified by students.
        \item Requirements defined in internship postings.
        \item Dynamic filtering and scoring to identify the best candidates.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Notification Service} \\
    Ensures timely communication between users and the system. Key responsibilities include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Sending real-time notifications about new internships, application updates, and feedback requests.
        \item Notifying universities about complaints involving their students.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Feedback and Complaint Service} \\
    Handles user feedback and complaints to improve system quality and resolve issues:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Collects feedback on internships and the recommendation system.
        \item Manages complaints from students and companies, notifying universities when necessary.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Form Management Service} \\
    Supports the creation and evaluation of application forms for internship screening:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Allows companies to design custom forms with open and closed questions.
        \item Processes and stores completed forms from students.
        \item Provides tools for companies to grade forms and generate candidate rankings.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Database Service} \\
    Manages the persistence layer for storing all user, internship, and system-related data. The database is designed to:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Support distributed storage for scalability and reliability.
        \item Enforce strict access controls to ensure data privacy and security.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Communication Between Components}
All services communicate via \textbf{RESTful APIs}, ensuring interoperability and modularity. Each service exposes specific endpoints to support its operations, allowing:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Seamless integration between services, ensuring the system functions as a cohesive whole.
    \item Flexibility for future enhancements or replacement of individual components without impacting the overall architecture.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Design Benefits}
The componentized design allows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Independent development, deployment, and scaling of services based on demand.
    \item Enhanced maintainability, as each service is responsible for a specific functionality.
    \item High availability and resilience, as the failure of one component does not impact the entire system.
\end{itemize}
